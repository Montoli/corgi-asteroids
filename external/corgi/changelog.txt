New in version 2.0.0:
* Gave AddFromRawData a default implementation.  (No longer pure virtual.)  This means it's no longer a required override.
* Refactoring!
  * Component has been renamed System
  * ComponentData has been renamed Component
* delta_time changed from int -> double



Todo:
* Real dependency tracking
* Automatic Multithreading scheduling
* Specialization for systems that have no data
* networking!
* remove the allocation location parameter to addentity.
